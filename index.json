We need to estimate actual variance components of the animals under study in practical application. Especially, if: we are interested in a new trait, from which no parameters are available variances and covariances might have changed over time considerable changes have occurred in a population e.g. due to recent importations. Here is a brief overview of the methods used in VCE. We use AI-REML method as default in BLUPF90. We can use EM-REML and Gibbs Sampling also, depending on individual use cases. A good explanation of which method to use, can be found here. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0388.2008.00774.x Evolution of methods used for VCE In this example, we use simulated data and corresponding pedigree file to estimate the variance components. The model contains animals as random effect, farm, sex, year as fixed effects, and a single trait (observation). The following video explains the process in detail. This exmpale has also been taken from Y. Masuda’s awesome tutorial for BLUPF90 suite of programs.

The BLUP methodology solving MME bt Henderson is standard in this regard. BLUPF90+ is a combination of programs with which we can solve MME for simultaneously getting BLUE and BLUP values of animals for trait/s. BLUPF90+ In this example, we will try to solve the single trait (Pre weaning weight gain, WWG) with fixed effect (sex) and random effect (animal) from Chapter 3 data on animal model of Mrode(2014). Residual and genetic variances are assumed in this example. So, it is only concerned with solving MMEs with the BLUPF90 program. I will describe how to eastimate variance components in another video.

Though he was not working in the field of agriculture, his discovery laid the path (pun intended) toward revolutionizing the breeding and agriculture sector. Followed by Wright, scientists like Thompson, Henderson, Quaas, Meuwissen, Luo, Van Vleck, Mistzal, and many others extended his idea and derived the A-matrix or additive genetic relationship matrix or Numerator Relationship Matrix (NRM), Inverse of A-matrix (more realistic), and finally the Genomic Relationship Matrix (exploiting the Mendelian sampling term). These matrices are used to quantify the relationship between individuals in a population based on their genetic makeup. This is one of the four main pillars in estimating breeding values of animals (BLUP). Ways of computing the A/G-matrix more efficiently is still an active field of research in animal breeding. The pictures below provide a glimpse of the after-effect of Wright’s work over the past 100 years.

Greetings. I am Shamim and this is my blog Shamim’s Summaries. In this post, I will try to explain what this site is all about. As we know, animal husbandry education and research is basically divided into these segments, i.e., ABG, Nutrition, Management, Processed products and marketing, which themselves have many sub-divisions. In this column, we will try to take a look at how we can discuss these topics in this group in an organized manner and develop a good sense of the recent trends and advances in these areas. Also, computer science has disrupted all the disciplines of study in this modern era. Ours is not an exception. So, we have to keep it in mind. ","date":"2022-02-07","objectID":"/first_post/:0:0","tags":["overview","introduction"],"title":"A brief overview of the popular research streams in Animal Husbandry","uri":"/first_post/"},{"categories":["overview"],"content":"ABG We will start with ABG aka Animal Breeding and Genetics. If we look at the development of ABG throughout history, we can see that it started with just simple observations and organized mating of animals (The Bakewell Age). Then with the progress of quantitative genetics, it developed rapidly (Lush, Henderson). And, after the advent of genomic selection (Meuwissen, 2001), ABG has gone through a new paradigm shift. Broadly we can talk about three topics in ABG. Quantitative genetics (statistics, mathematical models, and subsequently breeding programs) Molecular genetics (Sequencing, GWAS, characterization of genes, epigenomics, etc.) Reproductive biotechnology (AI, MOET, IVF, IVM, IVP, SCNT, sexed semen. CRISPR, and other gene-editing tech.) Now, nearly all of these three require the knowledge of basic Linux and at least one stat language (R) and, preferably, one general-purpose language (Python). So, if you have expertise on these, I request that you share your guides and insights here through the comments below. You can also post your code snippets here related to Animal Husbandry. Most often, when we want to learn to program, we cannot find code examples related to our studies, which is quite off-putting. Quantitative genetics works at the macro level and gives us the foundational tools for delving deep into the molecular part. Genomic selection coupled with modern reproductive biotechnology has further refined and boosted this industry and made it what it is today.
