Now, extract it in your computer and you will get these 3 folders (bin, doc, examples). Go to the /bin folder and rename vce-Windows-x86_64-gfortran-6.0.2 to vce6 and copy this file. Then go to C:/WIndows/System32/ folder and paste the vce6 file here. Permit all system authorization when the prompt arrives. Congratulations, VCE version 6.0.2 is successfully installed. I will add more info on how to run commands for vce later.

Greetings. I am Shamim and this is my blog Shamim’s Summaries. In this post, I will try to explain what this site is all about. As we know, animal husbandry education and research is basically divided into these segments, i.e., ABG, Nutrition, Management, Processed products and marketing, which themselves have many sub-divisions. In this column, we will try to take a look at how we can discuss these topics in this group in an organized manner and develop a good sense of the recent trends and advances in these areas. Also, computer science has disrupted all the disciplines of study in this modern era. Ours is not an exception. So, we have to keep it in mind. ","date":"2022-02-07","objectID":"/first_post/:0:0","tags":["overview","introduction"],"title":"A brief overview of the popular research streams in Animal Husbandry","uri":"/first_post/"},{"categories":["overview"],"content":"ABG We will start with ABG aka Animal Breeding and Genetics. If we look at the development of ABG throughout history, we can see that it started with just simple observations and organized mating of animals (The Bakewell Age). Then with the progress of quantitative genetics, it developed rapidly (Lush, Henderson). And, after the advent of genomic selection (Meuwissen, 2001), ABG has gone through a new paradigm shift. Broadly we can talk about three topics in ABG. Quantitative genetics (statistics, mathematical models, and subsequently breeding programs) Molecular genetics (Sequencing, GWAS, characterization of genes, epigenomics, etc.) Reproductive biotechnology (AI, MOET, IVF, IVM, IVP, SCNT, sexed semen. CRISPR, and other gene-editing tech.) Now, nearly all of these three require the knowledge of basic Linux and at least one stat language (R) and, preferably, one general-purpose language (Python). So, if you have expertise on these, I request that you share your guides and insights here through the comments below. You can also post your code snippets here related to Animal Husbandry. Most often, when we want to learn to program, we cannot find code examples related to our studies, which is quite off-putting. Quantitative genetics works at the macro level and gives us the foundational tools for delving deep into the molecular part. Genomic selection coupled with modern reproductive biotechnology has further refined and boosted this industry and made it what it is today.
