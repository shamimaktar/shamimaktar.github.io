# How to install VCE 6.0.2 on a Windows x86 64-bit machine



	**This is the version6 of VCE a package for estimating 
	(co)variance components by REML and Gibbs Sampling
	
	The vce6 directory contains 3 subdirectories:
	
	 bin      - contains executables for a number of
	            computing platforms
	            
	 doc      - contains the documentation in A4 and 
	            US Letter format
	            
	 examples - contains just that: data and parameter files 
	            that should run out of the box after installation**

**1.** First, go to this [link](https://www.openagrar.de/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/openagrar_derivate_00022208/vce.zip "this link") and download the 53.24MB zip file.


**2.** Now, extract it in your computer and you will get these 3 folders (bin, doc, examples).
