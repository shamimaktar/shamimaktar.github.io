# How to install VCE 6.0.2 on a Windows x86 64-bit machine



	**This is the version6 of VCE a package for estimating 
	(co)variance components by REML and Gibbs Sampling
	
	The vce6 directory contains 3 subdirectories:
	
	 bin      - contains executables for a number of
	            computing platforms
	            
	 doc      - contains the documentation in A4 and 
	            US Letter format
	            
	 examples - contains just that: data and parameter files 
	            that should run out of the box after installation**
	
First, go to this [link](https://www.openagrar.de/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/openagrar_derivate_00022208/vce.zip "this link") and download the 53.24MB zip file.

Now, extract it in your computer and you will get these 3 folders (bin, doc, examples).

Go to the **/bin** folder and rename **vce-Windows-x86_64-gfortran-6.0.2** to **vce6** and copy this file.

Then go to C:/WIndows/System32/ folder and paste the **vce6** file here. Permit all system authorization when the prompt arrives.

Congratulations, VCE version 6.0.2 is successfully installed.

I will add more info on how to run commands for vce later.
