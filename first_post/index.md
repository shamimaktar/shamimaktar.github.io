# Introduction

**A**ssalamualaikum. Greetings. I am Shamim and this is my blog **Shamim's Summaries**. In this post, I will try to explain what this site is all about.

As we know, animal husbandry education and research is basically divided into these segments, i.e., ABG, Nutrition, Management, Processed products and marketing, which themselves have many sub-divisions. In this column, we will try to take a look at how we can discuss these topics in this group in an organized manner and develop a good sense of the recent trends and advances in these areas. Also, computer science has disrupted all the disciplines of study in this modern era. Ours is not an exception. So, we have to keep it in mind.

## ABG

We will start with ABG aka **Animal Breeding and Genetics**. If we look at the development of ABG throughout history, we can see that it started with just simple observations and organized mating of animals (The Bakewell Age). Then with the progress of quantitative genetics, it developed rapidly (Lush, Henderson). And, after the advent of genomic selection (Meuwissen, 2001), ABG has gone through a new paradigm shift.

Broadly we can talk about three topics in ABG.

1. Quantitative genetics (statistics, mathematical models, and subsequently breeding programs)

2. Molecular genetics (Sequencing, GWAS, characterization of genes, epigenomics, etc.)

3. Reproductive biotechnology (AI, MOET, IVF, IVM, IVP, SCNT, sexed semen. CRISPR, and other gene-editing tech.)

Now, nearly all of these three require the knowledge of basic Linux and at least one stat language (R) and, preferably, one general-purpose language (Python). So, if you have expertise on these, I request that you share your guides and insights here through the comments below. You can also post your code snippets here related to Animal Husbandry. Most often, when we want to learn to program, we cannot find code examples related to our studies, which is quite off-putting.

Quantitative genetics works at the macro level and gives us the foundational tools for delving deep into the molecular part. Genomic selection coupled with modern reproductive biotechnology has further refined and boosted this industry and made it what it is today.

## AN

**Nutrition** can be divided into these groups

1. Feeds, feeding, feed milling, and alternative feeds.

2. Nutritional physiology

3. Reducing enteric methane (GHG) emission and other factors related to climate change

4. Metabolomics, proteomics, nutrigenomics.

## Management

**Management** has these topics under its umbrella

1. Housing and rearing systems (modern automated approach coupled with IoT and machine learning)

2. Welfare (significant funding in welfare research nowadays)

3. Behaviour

## Product-based

**Processed products and marketing** include these.

1. Poultry and dairy product processing technology

2. Supply Chain technology (food traceability, blockchain)


## Purpose of this blog

I consider myself a lifelong learner, and I always try to get the complete picture of the field I am studying. In this blog, I will try to post interpretive summaries of important papers in the field of the **Animal Sciences.** You can also find specific content by searching or navigating through the *categories* and *tags* section above on the site. I would love to see you participate in the comment section (you can comment anonymously if you'd prefer that) and share your knowledge and opinions.

Also, I will post book reviews of my recently read books.
