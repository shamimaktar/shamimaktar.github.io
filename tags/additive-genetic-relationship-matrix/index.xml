            </div>In the year 1922, Sewall Wright first documented the idea of tracing paths to establish the relationships among animals. Though he was not working in the field of agriculture, his discovery laid the path (pun intended) toward revolutionizing the breeding and agriculture sector. Followed by Wright, scientists like Thompson, Henderson, Quaas, Meuwissen, Luo, Van Vleck, Mistzal, and many others extended his idea and derived the A-matrix or additive genetic relationship matrix or Numerator Relationship Matrix (NRM), Inverse of A-matrix (more realistic), and finally the Genomic Relationship Matrix (exploiting the Mendelian sampling term).]]></description>
